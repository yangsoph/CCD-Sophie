# KRegCCD calibration notes

Working notes on assessing how well **KRegCCD** (the full-support regularised clade-conditional
distribution) is calibrated against held-out trees, and how it compares to CCD1 and CCD0. Covers the
PIT histogram experiment done so far, an effective-sample-size caveat on the fitted parameters, the
planned floor-lowering re-run, and the menu of other calibration experiments we have discussed.

Status as of 2026-06-18: PIT histogram experiment complete on Yule50. The planned re-run (CONTIGUOUS
folds, lowered mu floor, alpha pinned at 0.4, 100 reps) is also done; results in section 4. The other
experiments are proposed, not yet built.

---

## 1. What "calibration" means here

The model `q` is fit to a set of training trees and we ask whether the probabilities it assigns to
*held-out* trees are statistically consistent with how often those trees actually occur. Two
distinct ways a model can fail:

- **Shape miscalibration** — among the trees it *can* score, the assigned probabilities are
  systematically too high or too low (over/under-confident).
- **Coverage failure** — the model assigns probability **zero** to held-out trees (novel clades), so
  those trees can never fall in any credible set. This is the failure full support is meant to cure;
  CCD0/CCD1 suffer from it, KRegCCD does not.

We keep these two axes separate throughout.

---

## 2. The PIT histogram test (done)

### Statistic
For each held-out test tree `T` we compute the **probability-integral-transform** statistic

```
u(T) = P_{S ~ q}[ q(S) >= q(T) ]
```

— the probability that a tree drawn from the model is at least as probable as `T` — estimated by
Monte Carlo (fraction of 100k model samples with log-prob ≥ `log q(T)`). This is exactly the credible
level at which `T` first enters the model's highest-probability credible set, i.e. the statistic
underlying the credible-set coverage curve. **If `q` is calibrated and `T ~ q`, then
`u(T) ~ Uniform(0,1)`.** The coverage curve is the empirical CDF of `u`; the PIT histogram is its
density view, which localises the failure (∪ = over-confident, ∩ = under-confident, slope = bias).

### Randomized PIT
The tree distribution is discrete, so the raw `u(T)` is not exactly uniform (it clumps on achievable
mass levels). We use the **randomized PIT** `V(T) ~ Uniform(u_lo, u_hi)`, with
`u_lo = P[q(S) > q(T)]` and `u_hi = P[q(S) >= q(T)]`, which is exactly `Uniform(0,1)` under `T ~ q`
(Dunn & Smyth 1996). The histograms and tests use `V`.

### Pooling across replicates
Each replicate is an independent simulated dataset with its own posterior. We pool the PIT across
replicates: each tree's `u` is computed under *its own* replicate's fitted model, and a mixture of
uniforms is uniform, so pooling is valid and simply lowers sampling noise.

### Metric: L1, not the p-values
We report the **L1 calibration error** `sum_i | count_i/m - 1/B |` (L1 distance of the histogram from
uniform; the density analogue of the coverage curve's "L1 norm"). We do **not** lead with the
chi-square / KS p-values: pooling makes `m` large (up to ~3×10^5 here), and at that size the tests
reject any infinitesimal deviation — every p-value in the final run is ≈0, including for visibly flat
KRegCCD panels. L1 is an effect size; its H0 noise floor is `≈ 0.798·sqrt((B-1)/m)`, which shrinks
like `1/sqrt(m)`, so it stays meaningful. (Noise floor at B=20: ~0.20 at m=300, ~0.045 at m=6000,
~0.007 at m=3×10^5.) The p-values are kept in the TSV and shown small on the figure for completeness.

### Setup
- Data: Yule, 50 taxa, figshare collection 7102354 (local copy at
  `~/Git/cladeDiscoveryCurve/data/Yule50`). Each replicate has two **independent** MCMC chains:
  `run1` (training) and `run2` (testing), ~35k trees each. Using independent chains for train/test
  means the held-out split is clean (no shared autocorrelation across the split).
- Sample sizes (even-thinned subsamples): n = 300, 1000, 3000, for both training and testing.
- Models: KRegCCD (`withOptimisedParameters`), CCD1, CCD0.
- 99 replicates pooled in this run. rep100 was skipped because its run trees are *misnamed*
  `yule-n50-0.trees` (a 100→0 collision in the data pipeline), not missing — the files are complete
  (35,001 trees, 50 taxa). `KRegPITSweep` now globs the single `<prefix>*.trees` per run dir instead
  of reconstructing the name, so the planned re-run will include all 100.

### Results

| n | KRegCCD L1 (excl.) | CCD1 L1 (excl.) | CCD0 L1 (excl.) |
|------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 300  | **0.102** (0%)     | 0.028 (29%)      | 0.632 (11%)      |
| 1000 | **0.055** (0%)     | 0.022 (14%)      | 0.653 (5%)       |
| 3000 | **0.039** (0%)     | 0.019 (8%)       | 0.672 (2%)       |

Figure: `pit-yule50.pdf` (3×3 grid, rows = n, cols = model), data `pit-yule50.tsv`.

- **KRegCCD** is the only full-support model (0% excluded) and the only one that is both well-shaped
  *and* covers every test tree. Its L1 improves with n but stays above the noise floor — a small
  residual shape miscalibration remains even at n=3000 (see §3 and §4 for a likely cause).
- **CCD1** has the *flattest* histogram on the trees it supports (lowest L1) but **excludes 8–29%**
  of held-out trees — its failure is coverage, not shape. On the figure this is the green L1 next to
  the red "excl." annotation.
- **CCD0** is grossly shape-miscalibrated (L1 ≈ 0.63–0.67, a monotonic ramp toward `u→1`, i.e. it
  assigns the real trees far less probability than its own typical samples), and does not improve
  with n.
- All χ²/KS p-values ≈ 0 — confirms L1 was the right headline.

### Fitted parameters
Figure: `pit-yule50-params.pdf` (log-log scatter of the 297 `(alpha, mu)` pairs coloured by n),
data `pit-yule50.params.tsv`.

- Median `alpha`: 0.46 → 0.40 → 0.36; median `mu`: 0.0043 → 0.0015 → **0.0010** for n = 300/1000/3000.
  Both fall with n; escape mass `mu` falls fastest.
- **72 of 99 fits at n=3000 (and 21 at n=1000) are pinned at the `mu = 1e-3` search floor.** At large
  n the optimiser's lower bound is binding — the data wants *less* escape mass than the grid allows.
  Only one n=300 fit touches the 0.05 ceiling. This both makes the large-n parameter estimates
  unreliable and may cap KRegCCD's large-n calibration (μ is held above its true optimum).

---

## 3. Caveat: ESS ≠ nominal sample size

The "sample size" axis (300/1000/3000 trees) is the **nominal** count of thinned posterior trees, not
the **effective** sample size (ESS) — the number of effectively independent topologies. MCMC trees
are autocorrelated, and thinning 35k → n does not remove that; the topological ESS can be far below n
and may **saturate** (a chain only explores so many effectively independent topologies, so beyond some
point extra correlated trees add little information). Consequences:

1. **The n axis overstates information.** "n = 3000" may carry far less independent signal than 3000;
   the apparent `mu → floor` and `alpha ↓` trends with n could partly reflect ESS rising then
   saturating rather than genuine large-sample behaviour. Parameters should arguably be plotted
   against **ESS**, not nominal n.

2. **The (alpha, mu) selection may be overfit.** `KRegCCDParameterOptimiser.optimise` chooses
   `(alpha, mu)` by maximising **k-fold cross-validated** held-out log-probability, with the default
   **`STRIDED`** fold assignment (tree `i` → fold `i mod b`). On an autocorrelated chain, strided
   folds put each held-out tree's near-neighbours (highly correlated) into the *training* part of the
   same fold, so the CV held-out set is **not independent** of its training set. CV then
   *underestimates* generalisation error and selects **under-regularised** parameters — too-small
   `mu`, too-small `alpha`. This is a plausible driver of both the `mu`-floor pinning at large n and
   the residual KRegCCD shape miscalibration. (The *final* PIT evaluation on `run2` is clean — it is
   an independent chain — so the calibration verdict stands; it is the *parameter fitting* that is
   suspect.)

### Remedies to try
- Measure topological ESS of the chains (e.g. clade-trace / pseudo-ESS) and re-plot fitted parameters
  against ESS instead of nominal n.
- Thin training trees by the autocorrelation time so that nominal n ≈ ESS before fitting.
- **Done:** switched the CV default from `STRIDED` to **`CONTIGUOUS`** (block folds) in
  `KRegCCDParameterOptimiser` — a contiguous held-out block is far less correlated with its training
  set, so the objective is honest for autocorrelated samples. Correct on principle, but a 1-rep check
  (below) shows it barely moves the fitted `mu`, so it is a correctness fix, not the cure for the
  floor-pinning. (Affects all `withOptimisedParameters` callers, incl. the credible-set experiment.)
- Sanity check: select `(alpha, mu)` on the independent `run2` chain rather than internal CV, and see
  how much the parameters move.

## 4. Planned re-run: lower the mu floor (+ ESS arm)

Goal: get unconstrained large-n fits and test whether the residual KRegCCD miscalibration is an
artefact of the floor or of overfitting.

**Arm A — lower the search floor (DONE).** In `KRegCCDParameterOptimiser`: `MU_LO` `1e-3` → `1e-4`,
`MU_GRID` `41` → `61` (keep per-decade density over the wider range), and a floor warning mirroring
the existing ceiling warning. Verified: a 2-rep n=3000 check now finds interior optima below the old
floor (rep2 `mu = 0.00031`, impossible under the 1e-3 grid) with no floor warning firing — the lowered
floor is reachable and not itself binding here.

**Arm B — ESS-aware fitting (DONE: CONTIGUOUS is now the default).** The worry was that strided CV
overfits and pins `mu` artificially low. A 1-rep check (STRIDED vs CONTIGUOUS) shows otherwise: fitted
`mu` is essentially unchanged — n=300/1000/3000 `mu` = 0.01046/0.00357/0.00122 (STRIDED) →
0.01046/0.00323/0.00110 (CONTIGUOUS), i.e. slightly *lower*, not higher; `alpha` shifts modestly and
not in a clean direction. So **the floor-pinning is a genuine preference for small `mu` at large n,
not a strided artifact** — Arm A is still required. (Autocorrelation thinning to ESS remains a
possible refinement, but the param effect looks small.)

**Then:** re-run the sweep with both changes (CONTIGUOUS default + lowered floor), now over all 100
reps (~8 h, seeded → reproducible), and re-render `pit-yule50*.pdf`. Expect the floor-pinning to
resolve under Arm A (interior `mu` at large n); whether the n=3000 KRegCCD L1 then improves is the
open question.

### Re-run results (2026-06-18, DONE)

Ran the full sweep with all three changes in place: CONTIGUOUS folds, `mu` floor lowered to 1e-4, and
`alpha` pinned at 0.4. All 100 reps, seed 42. Profiling first showed that tree-file parsing, not model
fitting, dominated wall time, so the sweep was given a buffered nexus reader, made to load each file
once per size (shared across the three models), and parallelised across replicates; it then finished
in about 39 minutes on 8 cores rather than the projected several hours. One consequence: the pooled
PIT histogram is bit-reproducible only single-threaded, because parallel sampling reorders the Monte
Carlo draws. That is pure MC noise (the fitted parameters are identical run to run), so the
calibration verdict is unaffected.

KRegCCD L1, this run (100 reps), against the earlier searched-`alpha` baseline (99 reps):

| n    | KRegCCD L1 (alpha=0.4) | KRegCCD L1 (searched alpha) |
|------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| 300  | 0.084                  | 0.102                        |
| 1000 | 0.052                  | 0.055                        |
| 3000 | 0.033                  | 0.039                        |

- **The `mu` floor-pinning is resolved.** With the floor at 1e-4, only 1 of 300 fits sits on it (0 at
  n=300, 0 at n=1000, 1 at n=3000), against 72 of 99 n=3000 fits pinned to the old 1e-3 floor. The
  per-size median `mu` is 0.0046, 0.0015, 0.00064 for n = 300/1000/3000; the n=3000 median sits below
  the old 1e-3 floor, confirming that floor was binding. The fitted-parameter figure is now a `mu`
  violin per sample size (the `alpha` axis carries no information once `alpha` is pinned).
- **Pinning `alpha` = 0.4 did not cost calibration; it slightly improved KRegCCD L1 at every size.**
  The held-out objective is shallow in `alpha` and the searched `alpha` clustered near 0.4, so dropping
  the `alpha` search loses nothing measurable and removes the per-`alpha` backbone rebuild (the cost
  that made the sweep slow). CCD1 and CCD0 are unaffected by the `alpha` change (CCD1 L1 ~0.02 with
  8-40% excluded; CCD0 L1 ~0.63-0.67), matching the baseline.
- The residual n=3000 KRegCCD miscalibration shrank (0.039 to 0.033) but did not vanish, so it is not
  solely a floor artefact. It stays above the L1 noise floor (~0.007 at m = 3e5).

## 5. Other calibration experiments discussed (not yet built)

Ordered roughly by value-per-effort. PIT histogram (above) was the first.

1. **Clade-marginal reliability diagram** — bin clades by their model marginal probability and compare
   to the empirical frequency of that clade among test trees ("are 90%-supported clades present 90% of
   the time?"). Lower-dimensional than whole-tree calibration, far more data per bin, and localises
   *which* conditional distributions are miscalibrated. High value.
2. **Novel-clade-stratified coverage** — repeat the PIT/coverage check conditioned on the number of
   novel clades in the test tree. This directly stress-tests the full-support claim on the trees
   CCD0/CCD1 zero out — the regime KRegCCD exists for.
3. **Per-tree probability reliability / ECE** — bin test trees by predicted `q(T)`, compare mean
   predicted probability to observed relative frequency; summarise as Expected Calibration Error.
   Calibrates the probability *values*, not just credible-set mass.
4. **KL / cross-entropy fit comparison** — held-out negative log-likelihood is the cross-entropy
   `H(p,q)`; **differences** of held-out NLL between models are exactly differences in `KL(p‖q)`
   (the unknown `H(p)` cancels), so they rank models by KL with no extra assumptions. For an absolute
   KL, estimate `H(p)` with a near-oracle reference model fit on a large sample. Full support is what
   makes `H(p,q)` finite — CCD0/CCD1 give `+∞` on novel-clade trees. Pair with the model self-entropy
   `H(q)` as a sharpness companion (calibration alone is insufficient — maximise sharpness subject to
   calibration). See the entropy writeup (`kregccd-entropy.tex`).
5. **Simulation-Based Calibration (SBC)** — across many simulated datasets, rank the true generating
   tree within the fitted model (via the mass-rank statistic); ranks should be uniform. Stronger than
   single-posterior coverage (tests the whole prior-predictive); the biggest build.
6. **Proper-scoring / Murphy decomposition** — the reliability component of the Brier (or log) score
   *is* a calibration metric, and ties calibration to sharpness in one number.
7. **MMD / energy two-sample test** — kernel two-sample test between model samples and held-out trees
   using a tree kernel/metric (Robinson–Foulds, Kendall–Colijn); an omnibus "are these the same
   distribution?" check needing no binning.

## 6. Files

Code:
- `src/ccd/experiments/regularisation/KRegPITExperiment.java` — single (model, test-set) PIT run;
  reusable static helpers (PIT, histogram, uniformity tests, L1).
- `src/ccd/experiments/regularisation/KRegPITSweep.java` — pools the PIT over reps × sizes × models;
  writes the PIT histogram TSV and the `(alpha, mu)` params TSV. Parallelised across replicates, with
  each (train, test) file loaded once per size and shared across models, and a per-cell seeded RNG.
- `src/ccd/model/KRegCCD.java` — added `getAlpha()` / `getMu()` (and an `alpha` field) so the sweep
  can record fitted parameters.
- `src/ccd/algorithms/regularisation/KRegCCDParameterOptimiser.java` — `FIXED_ALPHA` pins `alpha`
  (0.4) and skips the Brent search (set to `null` to restore it); CONTIGUOUS folds, `mu` floor 1e-4.
- Speedups in shared infra: `LoadOrStoreTrees` reads the trees block through a chunked buffer (not
  per-char `BufferedReader.read()`); `CladePartition`'s static `logTable` made thread-safe for
  parallel sampling.

Plots (matplotlib, vector output):
- `doc/plot_pit.py` — PIT histogram grid (L1 headline, 95% band, capped y-axis, off-scale peaks
  labelled).
- `doc/plot_params.py` — auto-selects by the data: `(alpha, mu)` log-log scatter when `alpha` varies,
  or a `mu` violin per sample size with jittered fits when `alpha` is pinned (constant). Search
  floor/ceiling lines in both.

Outputs (Yule50, seed 42):
- searched `alpha`, 99 reps: `doc/pit-yule50.pdf`, `doc/pit-yule50.tsv` (PIT grid + data);
  `doc/pit-yule50-params.pdf`, `doc/pit-yule50.params.tsv` (fitted-parameter scatter + data).
- `alpha` = 0.4, 100 reps: `doc/pit-yule50-fixedalpha.pdf`, `doc/pit-yule50-fixedalpha.tsv` (PIT grid +
  data); `doc/pit-yule50-fixedalpha-params.pdf`, `doc/pit-yule50-fixedalpha.params.tsv` (`mu` violin +
  data).

Reproducibility: model sampling uses each CCD's own seeded `Random` (not the global `Randomizer`),
deterministically seeded per (model, size, rep). Fitted parameters and the single-threaded run
reproduce bit-for-bit; the parallel PIT histogram varies only at Monte Carlo noise level (see
section 4).
